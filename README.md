# TUDarmstadt_SensorGlove_v3
This repository contains every software and hardware files from the sensory glove v3, developed by P. Weber, E. Rueckert, R. Calandra, P. Beckerle in 03.2016 at the TU Darmstadt.

The software is split into the arduino firmware, which runs on the sensory glove, and the MATLAB-Script, that is used to read out the data streamed to an external host. The software includes the modified libraries used for reading out the IMU, as well as the new created libraries for reading out the flex-sensors through the analog mux.

The hardware files include the circuit diagramm as well as the final board layout. Further STL-files from the electronic box have been added, so that it can be printed out.
